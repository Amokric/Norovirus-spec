# REQ-purpose
The goal of this project is to develop a reasonable replication of the Norovirus Model from the paper [NOROVIRUS OUTBREAKS: USING AGENT-BASED MODELING TO EVALUATE SCHOOL POLICIES](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7822182).

The paper examines the transmission of the virus among primary school classrooms, evaluating policies to reduce the number of children who become infected. 

The model focuses on the daily activities that allow for studentsâ€™ exposure to the virus including classroom activities and lunch.

To control the transmission, two policies were implemented to limit the amount of student-student interaction. The results demonstrated that implementation of either policy helps reduce the number of students who become ill and that the sooner the policy is implemented the shorter the duration of the outbreak.


## Goal

The goal of the model is to implement two policies in order to reduce the number of children who become infected. The model follows the daily activities that allow for students' exposure to the virus including, classroom activities and lunch/recess.

  ## Structure
  

- [[ REQ-SUp]] - The setup. This will initialise the model with all the details needed to run the simulation, it will include the generation of the students, the student network and for how long the simulation should run for.
