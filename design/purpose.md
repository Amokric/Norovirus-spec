# REQ-purpose
The goal of this project is to develop a reasonable replication of the Norovirus Model from the paper [NOROVIRUS OUTBREAKS: USING AGENT-BASED MODELING TO EVALUATE SCHOOL POLICIES](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7822182).

This will be done through two different frameworks:

  1. [NetLogo ](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/)
 
  2. [PanaXea](https://pypi.org/project/PanaXea/)
