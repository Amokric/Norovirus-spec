## Model

The requirements for the model will outline what the model must do to reach the goals defined in the REQ-purpose. 

In order to run the model and produce the results wanted, it should have:
- Agents with attributes and behaviours
- Agent environment
- Agent connections and relationships

The main conceptual objects for the model have their own specifications and they are listed below:

1. [[SPC-model_agents]] - Initialise agents within the model.
2. [[SPC-model_network]] - Set up the networks between the students
3. [[SPC-model_disease]] - Initialise the disease within the model and set up the disease progression
4. [[SPC-model_background]] - Initialise the model baseline and then setup the mitigation strategies as options within the model

### The Model Process

The process of this model should follow a daily route to evaluate the chances of exposure for the students. At the end of each day, we update the status of our students' health status, which is then checked again at the beginning of the next day, if our student is symptomatic, then they are sent back home and the other students proceed with their day evaluation.

What shall be outputted from the programme after it has been run.
### Programme Report

When the program is complete it shall report:
1. Stabilising results across runs:
- Outbreak duration (days), this will include data from multiple runs.
2. Baseline Simulation Results:

From the data that is gathered from the runs, this will allow for specific results to be acquired for analysis. The results should include:
- Duration (days)
- Duration range (days)
- Max Absentee Rate 
- Total Number of Students Affected 
- Range of students affected across runs

#### NetLogo

When running the simulation from NetLogo you need to use the tool, BehaviourSpace. An example of the interface can be seen below, where you set up the amount runs you want to do and what output you want specifically.

This example shows that the simulation was run 4,000 times and was counting the students who were infected. 

#### PanaXea

For the PanaXea model, you can set up a Launcher.py. Here you just iterate through your model.run() however many times you want to and then put the data into a file.


# SPC-model_agents

### Initialise agents 

The Agents of the model will need to be initialised with three user-defined attributes.

This will include:
- Their status - susceptible, infected, recovered
- Days of infection
- Location - School or Home 

In total there should 126 agents within the model each split into six classrooms, of 21 students per class.

#### NetLogo commands of interest:

In NetLogo, the students can be segregated into six different breeds denoting the six classrooms.

1. "Sprout" 
2. "Breed"

#### PanaXea commands of interest:

You can set up a function to generate your students:
- [[.generate_students]]


To add the agents you must:

`model.schedule.agents.add(person)`

This allows agents to be added to the Schedule, which holds all simulation steppables and provides methods to progress simulation epochs.

### Initialise the model:
The Initial Model parameters include: 


<img width="374" alt="Screenshot 2020-07-30 at 01 40 34" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33029552/88867559-b6b1da80-d205-11ea-8a21-fe45d4a33e81.png">

The model will need these parameters and follow a process of evaluation to be executed.

### The intervention strategies as options within the model

The model should include mitigation strategies to limit the number of students being infected. If the rate of student reaches a certain amount these strategies should be put to place whilst the model is being run. 

1. Stop the students from doing group work 
2. Stop the students from doing group work and having lunch outside of class.

#### NetLogo commands of interest:
You can add onto the interface a Switch for each strategy if the Switch is 'on' then that strategy will do its intended purpose, prevent the students from interacting.


#### PanaXea commands of interest:
You can set up boolean attributes, for whether the student is having group work and lunch. These attributes will be set to true, however, if the absentee rate goes up then they will be set to false.


# SPC-model_disease
partof: REQ-model
###
### Initialise the disease

To initialise the disease you must change the attribute of the appropriate number of agents from susceptible to infected.

At the start of the model one "initial" agent is given the status of 'Sick'. The disease model is based on an SEIR compartment model. As the infected agent interacts with their connected neighbours or friends, they have a certain probability of infecting susceptible agents they come into contact with.

#### NetLogo commands of interest:
You can set up a global variable that has 1 as the value and then:
- "ask n-of initial-infected turtles" and set to be infected

#### PanaXea commands of interest:
You can go through the list of agents and randomly pick one agent and then set their attribute status as "sick". 
- random.choice() could be used.

### Disease progression

For the disease spread, it will depend on who the student is with. The probabilites will be evaluated more than once, as the students spend time with their seat neighbours and friends. 

#### Evaluating the chances of infection:

During the 5 days, the students have a chance of being infected with the virus by their neighbours, students they connect with for group work, and their lunch. For the spread of infection to happen, the chances will have to be evaluated. 

- Neighbours and group members: The probability of getting infected is 10%.

`p_of_infection_neighbour_groups = 0.10`


- Friend: The probability of getting infected is 12%.

`p_of_infection_friend = 0.12`


Each day you evaluate all the chances, therefore evaluating the chance of infection twice. When the students are in their classroom next to their neighbours, doing group work or at lunch. The chances of them being infected shall be evaluated. After the day finishes for the students, the status with either be updated or not, depending on if they acquired the infection throughout the day.

If the agent acquires the infection on day 1 it doesnâ€™t affect an evaluation on day 1, their status will be updated for the next day, where they will start the day with their status now being 'sick'.


# SPC-model_network
partof: REQ-model
###
### Initialise network:

#### Baseline network

The original model uses a small-world network to model the connections between the agents. To create this network you first need to connect each agent to the other agents within the classroom in a lattice structure which is visualised below:

<img width="253" alt="Screenshot 2020-07-30 at 01 25 23" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33029552/88866767-8bc68700-d203-11ea-8ab9-aa084c16e26d.png">

There should be six versions of this network within the model initially which will then get rewired twice.


#### Creating Neighbour Networks (Rewire 1):

The first rewire requires each connection to be evaluated. If a 60% chance is successful then the connection must be rewired to a random individual within the classroom.



#### Creating Friendship Networks (Rewire 2): 

The second rewire also requires each connection to be evaluated. If a 10% chance is successful then the connection must be rewired to a random individual in the different classroom.


#### NetLogo commands of interest:

1. "create-link" 
2. "list"

#### PanaXea commands of interest:

For generating the network, you can use NetworkX, which is a Python library for studying graphs and networks. You can generate the small-world network. You can find out more here -> [Watts Strogatz Graph](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/reference/generated/networkx.generators.random_graphs.watts_strogatz_graph.html)

Graphs work by generating a set of nodes and generating the edges. The main idea is that when the graph is generated, for each node on it, it represents a student. So for each node in nodes, a student will be appended to it. Once you have the nodes initialised with the students then you generate the graph from those nodes.


# TST-model_disease
## Test Disease Spread

Check:

- For the agents to be exposed to the virus, they need to be in school. During the weekend there should be no disease spread. 


- To test if the disease spread is correct, the total duration of the disease should be 5 days per student who is infected.

- The students who are infectious can only infect other students during the 2 day incubation period, after that, they are home.

- If someone is infected on Friday, then they will start their incubation period on Saturday, when Monday comes the infected student should have entered their isolation period, meaning that no matter how many students get infected on Friday, the disease outbreak will completely finish after 5 days. By Thursday the students infected would have all become healthy again.

The test output is to help see if we are meeting the requirements for what the model should be accurately outputting to us. 

- If the model only runs for 2 days, this could be that it is only taking into account the 2 days of incubation period and not the 3 days of isolation that the student needs to complete. It is important to make sure that the disease duration is lasting 5 days and nothing less than that.
- If the model run is lasting longer than 10 days from the results, something is incorrect.
